# Gratuitous Modbus Request
## How to run
- Change the IP address within the program
- `python modbus_client.py`

## How it works
It simply sends a WriteCoil request to a Modbus server device. Since Modbus does not support security mechanisms, such as authentication or encryption, the server device will happily perform any request asked to it by anyone.
